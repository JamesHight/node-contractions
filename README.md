````javascript
var contractions = require('contractions');

console.log(contractions.expand("I don't know who ya'll are."));

You can also use your own list of contractions / strings.

Note: Longer strings take precedent over short strings.


````javascript
var Contractions = require('contractions').Contractions;

var contractions = new Contractions({
	'asap': 'as soon as possible', // only lower case characters should be used in the list
	'a.s.a.p.': 'as soon as possible'
});


var text = 'asap';

text = contractions.expand(text);
console.log(text);
// Outputs: as soon as possible

text = contractions.contract(text);
console.log(text);
// Outputs: a.s.a.p.
